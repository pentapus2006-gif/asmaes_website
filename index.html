    <h1>Technovation Girls</h1>
    <p>Technovation Girls is a global program. Girls and mentors can connect with Technovation Girls locally through Chapters and Clubs. Chapters and Clubs provide a way for students to meet and work together as they complete the program. It is not mandatory to connect with your local Chapter or Club to participate; Technovation Girls is a free technology-based program for girls ages 10 - 18.

Working in teams (of 1 to 5), girls find a problem in their community and build a mobile app to help solve it. Along the way, they develop their collaboration, problem-solving, and leadership skills.

Technovation Girls will take 30+ hours to complete (we recommend allocated about 12 weeks to finish) and is completely free.</p>
